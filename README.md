# Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, & Tensorflow

This is a personal project of mine to go through **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, & Tensorflow by Aurelien Geron**.

## Chapters

Each chapter has their own programming challenges, snippets, etc that is provided to the reader. I'll be recording all of these into the github repo for all to enjoy :)
